Introduction
The CoinMarketCap API is a suite of high-performance RESTful JSON endpoints that are specifically designed to meet the mission-critical demands of application developers, data scientists, and enterprise business platforms.

This API reference includes all technical documentation developers need to integrate third-party applications and platforms. Additional answers to common questions can be found in the CoinMarketCap API FAQ.

Quick Start Guide
For developers eager to hit the ground running with the CoinMarketCap API here are a few quick steps to make your first call with the API.

Sign up for a free Developer Portal account. You can sign up at pro.coinmarketcap.com - This is our live production environment with the latest market data. Select the free Basic plan if it meets your needs or upgrade to a paid tier.
Copy your API Key. Once you sign up you'll land on your Developer Portal account dashboard. Copy your API from the API Key box in the top left panel.
Make a test call using your key. You may use the code examples provided below to make a test call with your programming language of choice. This example fetches all active cryptocurrencies by market cap and return market values in USD.
Be sure to replace the API Key in sample code with your own and use API domain pro-api.coinmarketcap.com or use the test API Key b54bcf4d-1bca-4e8e-9a24-22ff2c3d462c for sandbox-api.coinmarketcap.com testing with our sandbox environment. Please note that our sandbox api has mock data and should not be used in your application.
Postman Collection To help with development, we provide a fully featured postman collection that you can import and use immediately! Read more here.
Implement your application. Now that you've confirmed your API Key is working, get familiar with the API by reading the rest of this API Reference and commence building your application!
Note: Making HTTP requests on the client side with Javascript is currently prohibited through CORS configuration. This is to protect your API Key which should not be visible to users of your application so your API Key is not stolen. Secure your API Key by routing calls through your own backend service.

Authentication
Acquiring an API Key
All HTTP requests made against the CoinMarketCap API must be validated with an API Key. If you don't have an API Key yet visit the API Developer Portal to register for one.

Using Your API Key
You may use any server side programming language that can make HTTP requests to target the CoinMarketCap API. All requests should target domain https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com.

You can supply your API Key in REST API calls in one of two ways:

Preferred method: Via a custom header named X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY
Convenience method: Via a query string parameter named CMC_PRO_API_KEY
Security Warning: It's important to secure your API Key against public access. The custom header option is strongly recommended over the querystring option for passing your API Key in a production environment.

API Key Usage Credits
Most API plans include a daily and monthly limit or "hard cap" to the number of data calls that can be made. This usage is tracked as API "call credits" which are incremented 1:1 against successful (HTTP Status 200) data calls made with your key with these exceptions:

Account management endpoints, usage stats endpoints, and error responses are not included in this limit.
Paginated endpoints: List-based endpoints track an additional call credit for every 100 data points returned (rounded up) beyond our 100 data point defaults. Our lightweight /map endpoints are not included in this limit and always count as 1 credit. See individual endpoint documentation for more details.
Bundled API calls: Many endpoints support resource and currency conversion bundling. Bundled resources are also tracked as 1 call credit for every 100 resources returned (rounded up). Optional currency conversion bundling using the convert parameter also increment an additional API call credit for every conversion requested beyond the first.
You can log in to the Developer Portal to view live stats on your API Key usage and limits including the number of credits used for each call. You can also find call credit usage in the JSON response for each API call. See the status object for details. You may also use the /key/info endpoint to quickly review your usage and when daily/monthly credits reset directly from the API.

Note: "day" and "month" credit usage periods are defined relative to your API subscription. For example, if your monthly subscription started on the 5th at 5:30am, this billing anchor is also when your monthly credits refresh each month. The free Basic tier resets each day at UTC midnight and each calendar month at UTC midnight.

Endpoint Overview
The CoinMarketCap API is divided into 8 top-level categories
Endpoint Category	Description
/cryptocurrency/*	Endpoints that return data around cryptocurrencies such as ordered cryptocurrency lists or price and volume data.
/exchange/*	Endpoints that return data around cryptocurrency exchanges such as ordered exchange lists and market pair data.
/global-metrics/*	Endpoints that return aggregate market data such as global market cap and BTC dominance.
/tools/*	Useful utilities such as cryptocurrency and fiat price conversions.
/blockchain/*	Endpoints that return block explorer related data for blockchains.
/fiat/*	Endpoints that return data around fiats currencies including mapping to CMC IDs.
/partners/*	Endpoints for convenient access to 3rd party crypto data.
/key/*	API key administration endpoints to review and manage your usage.
/content/*	Endpoints that return cryptocurrency-related news, headlines, articles, posts, and comments.
Endpoint paths follow a pattern matching the type of data provided
Endpoint Path	Endpoint Type	Description
*/latest	Latest Market Data	Latest market ticker quotes and averages for cryptocurrencies and exchanges.
*/historical	Historical Market Data	Intervals of historic market data like OHLCV data or data for use in charting libraries.
*/info	Metadata	Cryptocurrency and exchange metadata like block explorer URLs and logos.
*/map	ID Maps	Utility endpoints to get a map of resources to CoinMarketCap IDs.
Cryptocurrency and exchange endpoints provide 2 different ways of accessing data depending on purpose
Listing endpoints: Flexible paginated */listings/* endpoints allow you to sort and filter lists of data like cryptocurrencies by market cap or exchanges by volume.
Item endpoints: Convenient ID-based resource endpoints like */quotes/* and */market-pairs/* allow you to bundle several IDs; for example, this allows you to get latest market quotes for a specific set of cryptocurrencies in one call.
Standards and Conventions
Each HTTP request must contain the header Accept: application/json. You should also send an Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip header to receive data fast and efficiently.

Endpoint Response Payload Format
All endpoints return data in JSON format with the results of your query under data if the call is successful.

A Status object is always included for both successful calls and failures when possible. The Status object always includes the current time on the server when the call was executed as timestamp, the number of API call credits this call utilized as credit_count, and the number of milliseconds it took to process the request as elapsed. Any details about errors encountered can be found under the error_code and error_message. See Errors and Rate Limits for details on errors.

{
  "data" : {
    ...
  },
  "status": {
    "timestamp": "2018-06-06T07:52:27.273Z",
    "error_code": 400,
    "error_message": "Invalid value for \"id\"",
    "elapsed": 0,
    "credit_count": 0
  }
}
Cryptocurrency, Exchange, and Fiat currency identifiers
Cryptocurrencies may be identified in endpoints using either the cryptocurrency's unique CoinMarketCap ID as id (eg. id=1 for Bitcoin) or the cryptocurrency's symbol (eg. symbol=BTC for Bitcoin). For a current list of supported cryptocurrencies use our /cryptocurrency/map call.
Exchanges may be identified in endpoints using either the exchange's unique CoinMarketCap ID as id (eg. id=270 for Binance) or the exchange's web slug (eg. slug=binance for Binance). For a current list of supported exchanges use our /exchange/map call.
All fiat currency options use the standard ISO 8601 currency code (eg. USD for the US Dollar). For a current list of supported fiat currencies use our /fiat/map endpoint. Unless otherwise stated, endpoints with fiat currency options like our convert parameter support these 93 major currency codes:

Gold Troy Ounce	XAU	3575
Silver Troy Ounce	XAG	3574
Platinum Ounce	XPT	3577
Palladium Ounce	XPD	3576
Warning: Using CoinMarketCap IDs is always recommended as not all cryptocurrency symbols are unique. They can also change with a cryptocurrency rebrand. If a symbol is used the API will always default to the cryptocurrency with the highest market cap if there are multiple matches. Our convert parameter also defaults to fiat if a cryptocurrency symbol also matches a supported fiat currency. You may use the convenient /map endpoints to quickly find the corresponding CoinMarketCap ID for a cryptocurrency or exchange.

Bundling API Calls
Many endpoints support ID and crypto/fiat currency conversion bundling. This means you can pass multiple comma-separated values to an endpoint to query or convert several items at once. Check the id, symbol, slug, and convert query parameter descriptions in the endpoint documentation to see if this is supported for an endpoint.
Endpoints that support bundling return data as an object map instead of an array. Each key-value pair will use the identifier you passed in as the key.
For example, if you passed symbol=BTC,ETH to /v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest you would receive:

"data" : {
    "BTC" : {
      ...
    },
    "ETH" : {
      ...
    }
}
Or if you passed id=1,1027 you would receive:

"data" : {
    "1" : {
      ...
    },
    "1027" : {
      ...
    }
}
Price conversions that are returned inside endpoint responses behave in the same fashion. These are enclosed in a quote object.

Date and Time Formats
All endpoints that require date/time parameters allow timestamps to be passed in either ISO 8601 format (eg. 2018-06-06T01:46:40Z) or in Unix time (eg. 1528249600). Timestamps that are passed in ISO 8601 format support basic and extended notations; if a timezone is not included, UTC will be the default.
All timestamps returned in JSON payloads are returned in UTC time using human-readable ISO 8601 format which follows this pattern: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.mmmZ. The final .mmm designates milliseconds. Per the ISO 8601 spec the final Z is a constant that represents UTC time.
Data is collected, recorded, and reported in UTC time unless otherwise specified.
Versioning
The CoinMarketCap API is versioned to guarantee new features and updates are non-breaking. The latest version of this API is /v1/.

Errors and Rate Limits
API Request Throttling
Use of the CoinMarketCap API is subject to API call rate limiting or "request throttling". This is the number of HTTP calls that can be made simultaneously or within the same minute with your API Key before receiving an HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" throttling error. This limit scales with the usage tier and resets every 60 seconds. Please review our Best Practices for implementation strategies that work well with rate limiting.

HTTP Status Codes
The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API call.

400 (Bad Request) The server could not process the request, likely due to an invalid argument.
401 (Unauthorized) Your request lacks valid authentication credentials, likely an issue with your API Key.
402 (Payment Required) Your API request was rejected due to it being a paid subscription plan with an overdue balance. Pay the balance in the Developer Portal billing tab and it will be enabled.
403 (Forbidden) Your request was rejected due to a permission issue, likely a restriction on the API Key's associated service plan. Here is a convenient map of service plans to endpoints.
429 (Too Many Requests) The API Key's rate limit was exceeded; consider slowing down your API Request frequency if this is an HTTP request throttling error. Consider upgrading your service plan if you have reached your monthly API call credit limit for the day/month.
500 (Internal Server Error) An unexpected server issue was encountered.
Error Response Codes
A Status object is always included in the JSON response payload for both successful calls and failures when possible. During error scenarios you may reference the error_code and error_message properties of the Status object. One of the API error codes below will be returned if applicable otherwise the HTTP status code for the general error type is returned.

HTTP Status	Error Code	Error Message
401	1001 [API_KEY_INVALID]	This API Key is invalid.
401	1002 [API_KEY_MISSING]	API key missing.
402	1003 [API_KEY_PLAN_REQUIRES_PAYEMENT]	Your API Key must be activated. Please go to pro.coinmarketcap.com/account/plan.
402	1004 [API_KEY_PLAN_PAYMENT_EXPIRED]	Your API Key's subscription plan has expired.
403	1005 [API_KEY_REQUIRED]	An API Key is required for this call.
403	1006 [API_KEY_PLAN_NOT_AUTHORIZED]	Your API Key subscription plan doesn't support this endpoint.
403	1007 [API_KEY_DISABLED]	This API Key has been disabled. Please contact support.
429	1008 [API_KEY_PLAN_MINUTE_RATE_LIMIT_REACHED]	You've exceeded your API Key's HTTP request rate limit. Rate limits reset every minute.
429	1009 [API_KEY_PLAN_DAILY_RATE_LIMIT_REACHED]	You've exceeded your API Key's daily rate limit.
429	1010 [API_KEY_PLAN_MONTHLY_RATE_LIMIT_REACHED]	You've exceeded your API Key's monthly rate limit.
429	1011 [IP_RATE_LIMIT_REACHED]	You've hit an IP rate limit.
Best Practices
This section contains a few recommendations on how to efficiently utilize the CoinMarketCap API for your enterprise application, particularly if you already have a large base of users for your application.

Use CoinMarketCap ID Instead of Cryptocurrency Symbol
Utilizing common cryptocurrency symbols to reference cryptocurrencies on the API is easy and convenient but brittle. You should know that many cryptocurrencies have the same symbol, for example, there are currently three cryptocurrencies that commonly refer to themselves by the symbol HOT. Cryptocurrency symbols also often change with cryptocurrency rebrands. When fetching cryptocurrency by a symbol that matches several active cryptocurrencies we return the one with the highest market cap at the time of the query. To ensure you always target the cryptocurrency you expect, use our permanent CoinMarketCap IDs. These IDs are used reliably by numerous mission critical platforms and never change.

We make fetching a map of all active cryptocurrencies' CoinMarketCap IDs very easy. Just call our /cryptocurrency/map endpoint to receive a list of all active currencies mapped to the unique id property. This map also includes other typical identifiying properties like name, symbol and platform token_address that can be cross referenced. In cryptocurrency calls you would then send, for example id=1027, instead of symbol=ETH. It's strongly recommended that any production code utilize these IDs for cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and markets to future-proof your code.

Use the Right Endpoints for the Job
You may have noticed that /cryptocurrency/listings/latest and /cryptocurrency/quotes/latest return the same crypto data but in different formats. This is because the former is for requesting paginated and ordered lists of all cryptocurrencies while the latter is for selectively requesting only the specific cryptocurrencies you require. Many endpoints follow this pattern, allow the design of these endpoints to work for you!

Implement a Caching Strategy If Needed
There are standard legal data safeguards built into the Commercial User Terms that application developers should keep in mind. These Terms help prevent unauthorized scraping and redistributing of CMC data but are intentionally worded to allow legitimate local caching of market data to support the operation of your application. If your application has a significant user base and you are concerned with staying within the call credit and API throttling limits of your subscription plan consider implementing a data caching strategy.

For example instead of making a /cryptocurrency/quotes/latest call every time one of your application's users needs to fetch market rates for specific cryptocurrencies, you could pre-fetch and cache the latest market data for every cryptocurrency in your application's local database every 60 seconds. This would only require 1 API call, /cryptocurrency/listings/latest?limit=5000, every 60 seconds. Then, anytime one of your application's users need to load a custom list of cryptocurrencies you could simply pull this latest market data from your local cache without the overhead of additional calls. This kind of optimization is practical for customers with large, demanding user bases.

Code Defensively to Ensure a Robust REST API Integration
Whenever implementing any high availability REST API service for mission critical operations it's recommended to code defensively. Since the API is versioned, any breaking request or response format change would only be introduced through new versions of each endpoint, however existing endpoints may still introduce new convenience properties over time.

We suggest these best practices:

You should parse the API response JSON as JSON and not through a regular expression or other means to avoid brittle parsing logic.
Your parsing code should explicitly parse only the response properties you require to guarantee new fields that may be returned in the future are ignored.
You should add robust field validation to your response parsing logic. You can wrap complex field parsing, like dates, in try/catch statements to minimize the impact of unexpected parsing issues (like the unlikely return of a null value).
Implement a "Retry with exponential backoff" coding pattern for your REST API call logic. This means if your HTTP request happens to get rate limited (HTTP 429) or encounters an unexpected server-side condition (HTTP 5xx) your code would automatically recover and try again using an intelligent recovery scheme. You may use one of the many libraries available; for example, this one for Node or this one for Python.
Reach Out and Upgrade Your Plan
If you're uncertain how to best implement the CoinMarketCap API in your application or your needs outgrow our current self-serve subscription tiers you can reach out to api@coinmarketcap.com. We'll review your needs and budget and may be able to tailor a custom enterprise plan that is right for you.

Version History
The CoinMarketCap API utilizes Semantic Versioning in the format major.minor.patch. The current major version is incorporated into the API request path as /v1/. Non-breaking minor and patch updates to the API are released regularly. These may include new endpoints, data points, and API plan features which are always introduced in a non-breaking manner. This means you can expect new properties to become available in our existing /v1/ endpoints however any breaking change will be introduced under a new major version of the API with legacy versions supported indefinitely unless otherwise stated.

/cryptocurrency/quotes/historical and /v1/global-metrics/quotes/historical have new options to make charting tasks easier and more efficient. Use the new aux parameter to cut out response properties you don't need and include the new search_interval timestamp to normalize disparate historical records against the same interval time periods.
A 4 hour interval option 4h was added to all historical time series data endpoints.
v1.17.0 on Aug 22, 2019
/cryptocurrency/price-performance-stats/latest has been added as our 21st endpoint! It returns launch price ROI, all-time high / all-time low, and other price stats over several supported time periods.
/cryptocurrency/market-pairs/latest now has the ability to filter all active markets for a cryptocurrency to specific base/quote pairs. Want to return only BTC/USD and BTC/USDT markets? Just pass ?symbol=BTC&matched_symbol=USD,USDT or ?id=1&matched_id=2781,825.
/cryptocurrency/market-pairs/latest now features sort options including cmc_rank to reproduce the methodology based sort on pages like Bitcoin Markets.
/cryptocurrency/market-pairs/latest can now return any exchange level CMC notices affecting a market via the new notice aux parameter.
/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest will now continue to return the last updated price data for cryptocurrency that have transitioned to an inactive state instead of returning an HTTP 400 error.

/exchange/info now includes a brief text summary for most exchanges as description.
v1.16.0 on Aug 9, 2019
We've introduced a new partners category of endpoints for convenient access to 3rd party crypto data. FlipSide Crypto's Fundamental Crypto Asset Score (FCAS) is now available as the first partner integration.

We've also added a new aux auxiliary parameter to many endpoints which can be used to customize your request. You may request new supplemental data properties that are not returned by default or slim down your response payload by excluding default aux fields you don't need in endpoints like /cryptocurrency/listings/latest. /cryptocurrency/market-pairs/latest and /exchange/market-pairs/latest can now supply market_url, currency_name, and currency_slug for each market using this new parameter. /exchange/listings/latest can now include the exchange date_launched.
v1.14.1 on Jun 14, 2019 - DATA: Phase 1 methodology updates
Per our May 1 announcement of the Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance (DATA), a platform methodology update was published. No API changes are required but users should take note:

Exchanges that are not compliant with mandatory transparency requirements (Ability to surface live trade and order book data) will be excluded from VWAP price and volume calculations returned from our /cryptocurrency/ and /global-metrics/ endpoints going forward.
These exchanges will also return a volume_24h_adjusted value of 0 from our /exchange/ endpoints like the exclusions based on market category and fee type. Stale markets (24h or older) will also be excluded. All exchanges will continue to return exchange_reported values as reported.
We welcome you to learn more about the DATA alliance and become a partner.
v1.14.0 on Jun 3, 2019
/cryptocurrency/info now include up to 5 block explorer URLs for each cryptocurrency including our brand new Bitcoin and Ethereum Explorers.

We've updated requesting cryptocurrencies by slug to support legacy names from past cryptocurrency rebrands. For example, a request to /cryptocurrency/quotes/latest?slug=antshares successfully returns the cryptocurrency by current slug neo.
We've extended the brief text summary included as description in /cryptocurrency/info to now cover all cryptocurrencies!
We've added the fetch-by-slug option to /cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical.
Premium subscription users: On your next billing period we'll conveniently switch to displaying monthly/daily credit usage relative to your monthly billing period instead of calendar month and UTC midnight. Click the ? on our updated API Key Usage panel for more details.
v1.12.1 on May 1, 2019
To celebrate CoinMarketCap's 6th anniversary we've upgraded the crypto API to make more of our data available at each tier!
Our free Basic tier may now access live price conversions via /tools/price-conversion.
Our Hobbyist tier now supports a month of historical price conversions with /tools/price-conversion using the time parameter. We've also made this plan 12% cheaper at $29/mo with a yearly subscription or $35/mo month-to-month.
Our Startup tier can now access a month of cryptocurrency OHLCV data via /cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical along with /tools/price-conversion.
Our Standard tier has been upgraded from 1 month to now 3 months of historical market data access across all historical endpoints.
Our Enterprise, Professional, and Standard tiers now get access to a new #18th endpoint /cryptocurrency/listings/historical! Utilize this endpoint to fetch daily historical crypto rankings from the past. We've made historical ranking snapshots available all the way back to 2013!
All existing accounts and subscribers may take advantage of these updates. If you haven't signed up yet you can check out our updated plans on our feature comparison page.
v1.12.0 on Apr 28, 2019
Our API docs now supply API request examples in 7 languages for every endpoint: cURL, Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, C#, and Go.
Many customer sites format cryptocurrency data page URLs by SEO friendly names like we do here: coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-coin. We've made it much easier for these kinds of pages to dynamically reference data from our API. You may now request cryptocurrencies from our /cryptocurrency/info and /cryptocurrency/quotes/latest endpoints by slug as an alternative to symbol or id. As always, you can retrieve a quick list of every cryptocurrency we support and it's id, symbol, and slug via our /cryptocurrency/map endpoint.
We've increased convert limits on historical endpoints once more. You can now request historical market data in up to 3 conversion options at a time like we do internally to display line charts like this. You can now fetch market data converted into your primary cryptocurrency, fiat currency, and a parent platform cryptocurrency (Ethereum in this case) all in one call!
v1.11.0 on Mar 25, 2019
We now supply a brief text summary for each cryptocurrency in the description field of /cryptocurrency/info. The majority of top cryptocurrencies include this field with more coming in the future.
We've made convert limits on some endpoints and plans more flexible. Historical endpoints are now allowed 2 price conversion options instead of 1. Professional plan convert limit has doubled from 40 to 80. Enterprise has tripled from 40 to 120.
CoinMarketCap Market ID: We now return market_id in /market-pairs/latest endpoints. Like our cryptocurrency and exchange IDs, this ID can reliably be used to uniquely identify each market permanently as this ID never changes.
Market symbol overrides: We now supply an exchange_symbol in addition to currency_symbol for each market pair returned in our /market-pairs/latest endpoints. This allows you to reference the currency symbol provided by the exchange in case it differs from the CoinMarketCap identified symbol that the majority of markets use.
v1.10.1 on Jan 30, 2019
Our API health status dashboard is now public at http://status.coinmarketcap.com.
We now conveniently return market_cap in our /cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical endpoint so you don't have to make a separately query when fetching historic OHLCV data.
We've improved the accuracy of percent_change_1h / 24h / 7d calculations when using the convert option with our latest cryptocurrency endpoints.
/cryptocurrency/market-pairs/latest now updates more frequently, every 1 minute.
Contract Address and parent platform metadata changes are reflected on the API much more quickly.
v1.9.0 on Jan 8, 2019

We've also introduced currency conversions for four precious metals: Gold, Silver, Platinum, and Palladium!
You may pass all 97 fiat currency options to our /tools/price-conversion endpoint using either the symbol or id parameter. Using CMC id is always the most robust option. CMC IDs are now included in the full list of fiat options located here.
All historical endpoints including our price conversion endpoint with "time" parameter now support historical fiat conversions back to 2013!
v1.6.0 on Dec 4, 2018
We've rolled out another top requested feature, giving you access to platform metadata for cryptocurrencies that are tokens built on other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Look for the new platform property on our cryptocurrency endpoints like /cryptocurrency/listings/latest and /cryptocurrency/map.
We've also added a CMC equivalent pages section to our endpoint docs so you can easily determine which endpoints to use to reproduce functionality on the main coinmarketcap.com website.
Welcome Public API users! With the migration of our legacy Public API into the Professional API we now have 1 unified API at CMC. This API is now known as the CoinMarketCap API and can always be accessed at coinmarketcap.com/api.
v1.5.0 on Nov 28, 2018
/cryptocurrency/ohlcv/historical now supports hourly OHLCV! Use time_period="hourly" and don't forget to set the "interval" parameter to "hourly" or one of the new hourly interval options.

v1.3.0 on Nov 9, 2018
The latest UTC day's OHLCV record is now available sooner. 5-10 minutes after each UTC midnight.
We're now returning a new vol_24h_adjusted property on /exchange/quotes/latest and /exchange/listings/latest and a sort option for the latter so you may now list exchange rankings by CMC adjusted volume as well as exchange reported.
We are now returning a tags property with /cryptocurrency/listings/latest with our first tag mineable so you know which currencies are mineable. Additional tags will be introduced in the future.
We've increased the "convert" parameter limit from 32 to 40 for plans that support max conversion limits.
v1.2.0 on Oct 30, 2018
Our exchange listing and quotes endpoints now update much more frequently! Every 1 minute instead of every 5 minutes.
These latest exchange data endpoints also now return volume_7d / 30d and percent_change_volume_24h / 7d / 30d along with existing data.

CoinMarketCap ID Map
Returns a mapping of all cryptocurrencies to unique CoinMarketCap ids. Per our Best Practices we recommend utilizing CMC ID instead of cryptocurrency symbols to securely identify cryptocurrencies with our other endpoints and in your own application logic. Each cryptocurrency returned includes typical identifiers such as name, symbol, and token_address for flexible mapping to id.

By default this endpoint returns cryptocurrencies that have actively tracked markets on supported exchanges. You may receive a map of all inactive cryptocurrencies by passing listing_status=inactive. You may also receive a map of registered cryptocurrency projects that are listed but do not yet meet methodology requirements to have tracked markets via listing_status=untracked. Please review our methodology documentation for additional details on listing states.

Cryptocurrencies returned include first_historical_data and last_historical_data timestamps to conveniently reference historical date ranges available to query with historical time-series data endpoints. You may also use the aux parameter to only include properties you require to slim down the payload if calling this endpoint frequently.

This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic
Hobbyist
Startup
Standard
Professional
Enterprise
Cache / Update frequency: Mapping data is updated only as needed, every 30 seconds.
Plan credit use: 1 API call credit per request no matter query size.

Parameters
query Parameters ?
 listing_status	
string
"active"
Only active cryptocurrencies are returned by default. Pass inactive to get a list of cryptocurrencies that are no longer active. Pass untracked to get a list of cryptocurrencies that are listed but do not yet meet methodology requirements to have tracked markets available. You may pass one or more comma-separated values.

 start	
integer >= 1
1
Optionally offset the start (1-based index) of the paginated list of items to return.

 limit	
integer [ 1 .. 5000 ]
Optionally specify the number of results to return. Use this parameter and the "start" parameter to determine your own pagination size.

 sort	
string
"id"
"cmc_rank""id"
What field to sort the list of cryptocurrencies by.

 symbol	
string
Optionally pass a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency symbols to return CoinMarketCap IDs for. If this option is passed, other options will be ignored.

Parameters
query Parameters ?
 id	
string
One or more comma-separated CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency IDs. Example: "1,2"

 slug	
string
Alternatively pass a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency slugs. Example: "bitcoin,ethereum"

 symbol	
string
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "slug" or "symbol" is required for this request. Please note that starting in the v2 endpoint, due to the fact that a symbol is not unique, if you request by symbol each data response will contain an array of objects containing all of the coins that use each requested symbol. The v1 endpoint will still return a single object, the highest ranked coin using that symbol.

 address	
string
Alternatively pass in a contract address. Example: "0xc40af1e4fecfa05ce6bab79dcd8b373d2e436c4e"

 skip_invalid	
boolean
false
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if any invalid cryptocurrencies are requested or a cryptocurrency does not have matching records in the requested timeframe. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

 aux	
string
"urls,logo,description,tags,platform,date_added,notice"
Optionally specify a comma-separated list of supplemental data fields to return. Pass urls,logo,description,tags,platform,date_added,notice,status to include all auxiliary fields.

Listings Historical
Returns a ranked and sorted list of all cryptocurrencies for a historical UTC date.

Technical Notes

This endpoint is identical in format to our /cryptocurrency/listings/latest endpoint but is used to retrieve historical daily ranking snapshots from the end of each UTC day.
Daily snapshots reflect market data at the end of each UTC day and may be requested as far back as 2013-04-28 (as supported by your plan's historical limits).
The required "date" parameter can be passed as a Unix timestamp or ISO 8601 date but only the date portion of the timestamp will be referenced. It is recommended to send an ISO date format like "2019-10-10" without time.
This endpoint is for retrieving paginated and sorted lists of all currencies. If you require historical market data on specific cryptocurrencies you should use /cryptocurrency/quotes/historical.
Cryptocurrencies are listed by cmc_rank by default. You may optionally sort against any of the following:
cmc_rank: CoinMarketCap's market cap rank as outlined in our methodology.
name: The cryptocurrency name.
symbol: The cryptocurrency symbol.
market_cap: market cap (latest trade price x circulating supply).
price: latest average trade price across markets.
circulating_supply: approximate number of coins currently in circulation.
total_supply: approximate total amount of coins in existence right now (minus any coins that have been verifiably burned).
max_supply: our best approximation of the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in the lifetime of the currency.
num_market_pairs: number of market pairs across all exchanges trading each currency.
volume_24h: 24 hour trading volume for each currency.
percent_change_1h: 1 hour trading price percentage change for each currency.

Listings Latest
Returns a paginated list of all active cryptocurrencies with latest market data. The default "market_cap" sort returns cryptocurrency in order of CoinMarketCap's market cap rank (as outlined in our methodology) but you may configure this call to order by another market ranking field. Use the "convert" option to return market values in multiple fiat and cryptocurrency conversions in the same call.

You may sort against any of the following:
market_cap: CoinMarketCap's market cap rank as outlined in our methodology.
market_cap_strict: A strict market cap sort (latest trade price x circulating supply).
name: The cryptocurrency name.
symbol: The cryptocurrency symbol.
date_added: Date cryptocurrency was added to the system.
price: latest average trade price across markets.
circulating_supply: approximate number of coins currently in circulation.
total_supply: approximate total amount of coins in existence right now (minus any coins that have been verifiably burned).
max_supply: our best approximation of the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in the lifetime of the currency.
num_market_pairs: number of market pairs across all exchanges trading each currency.
market_cap_by_total_supply_strict: market cap by total supply.
volume_24h: rolling 24 hour adjusted trading volume.
volume_7d: rolling 24 hour adjusted trading volume.
volume_30d: rolling 24 hour adjusted trading volume.
percent_change_1h: 1 hour trading price percentage change for each currency.
percent_change_24h: 24 hour trading price percentage change for each currency.

OHLCV Historical v2
Returns historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data along with market cap for any cryptocurrency using time interval parameters. Currently daily and hourly OHLCV periods are supported. Volume is not currently supported for hourly OHLCV intervals before 2020-09-22.

Please note: This documentation relates to our updated V2 endpoint, which may be incompatible with our V1 versions. Documentation for deprecated endpoints can be found here.


Technical Notes

Only the date portion of the timestamp is used for daily OHLCV so it's recommended to send an ISO date format like "2018-09-19" without time for this "time_period".
One OHLCV quote will be returned for every "time_period" between your "time_start" (exclusive) and "time_end" (inclusive).
If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "time_period" will be calculated in reverse from "time_end" using the "count" parameter which defaults to 10 results.
If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
If you don't need every "time_period" between your dates you may adjust the frequency that "time_period" is sampled using the "interval" parameter. For example with "time_period" set to "daily" you may set "interval" to "2d" to get the daily OHLCV for every other day. You could set "interval" to "monthly" to get the first daily OHLCV for each month, or set it to "yearly" to get the daily OHLCV value against the same date every year.
Implementation Tips

If querying for a specific OHLCV date your "time_start" should specify a timestamp of 1 interval prior as "time_start" is an exclusive time parameter (as opposed to "time_end" which is inclusive to the search). This means that when you pass a "time_start" results will be returned for the next complete "time_period". For example, if you are querying for a daily OHLCV datapoint for 2018-11-30 your "time_start" should be "2018-11-29".
If only specifying a "count" parameter to return latest OHLCV periods, your "count" should be 1 number higher than the number of results you expect to receive. "Count" defines the number of "time_period" intervals queried, not the number of results to return, and this includes the currently active time period which is incomplete when working backwards from current time. For example, if you want the last daily OHLCV value available simply pass "count=2" to skip the incomplete active time period.
This endpoint supports requesting multiple cryptocurrencies in the same call. Please note the API response will be wrapped in an additional object in this case.
Interval Options

There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "time_period" and "interval" parameters. For "time_period" these return aggregate OHLCV data from the beginning to end of each interval period. Apply these time intervals to "interval" to adjust how frequently "time_period" is sampled.

The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
"hourly" - Hour intervals in UTC.
"daily" - Calendar day intervals for each UTC day.
"weekly" - Calendar week intervals for each calendar week.
"monthly" - Calendar month intervals for each calendar month.
"yearly" - Calendar year intervals for each calendar year.

The second are relative time intervals.
"h": Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h".
"d": Time periods that repeat every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".

Please note that "time_period" currently supports the "daily" and "hourly" options. "interval" supports all interval options.

Cache / Update frequency: Latest Daily OHLCV record is available ~5 to ~10 minutes after each midnight UTC. The latest hourly OHLCV record is available 5 minutes after each UTC hour.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per 100 OHLCV data points returned (rounded up) and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our historical cryptocurrency data pages like coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/.


Parameters
query Parameters ?
 id	
string
One or more comma-separated CoinMarketCap cryptocurrency IDs. Example: "1,1027"

 slug	
string
Alternatively pass a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency slugs. Example: "bitcoin,ethereum"

 symbol	
string
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "slug" or "symbol" is required for this request.

 time_period	
string
"daily"
"daily""hourly"
Time period to return OHLCV data for. The default is "daily". If hourly, the open will be 01:00 and the close will be 01:59. If daily, the open will be 00:00:00 for the day and close will be 23:59:99 for the same day. See the main endpoint description for details.

 time_start	
string
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to start returning OHLCV time periods for. Only the date portion of the timestamp is used for daily OHLCV so it's recommended to send an ISO date format like "2018-09-19" without time.

 time_end	
string
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to stop returning OHLCV time periods for (inclusive). Optional, if not passed we'll default to the current time. Only the date portion of the timestamp is used for daily OHLCV so it's recommended to send an ISO date format like "2018-09-19" without time.

 count	
number [ 1 .. 10000 ]
10
Optionally limit the number of time periods to return results for. The default is 10 items. The current query limit is 10000 items.

 interval	
string
"daily"
"hourly""daily""weekly""monthly""yearly""1h""2h""3h""4h""6h""12h""1d""2d""3d""7d""14d""15d""30d""60d""90d""365d"
Optionally adjust the interval that "time_period" is sampled. For example with interval=monthly&time_period=daily you will see a daily OHLCV record for January, February, March and so on. See main endpoint description for available options.

 convert	
string
By default market quotes are returned in USD. Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 3 fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies.

 convert_id	
string
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

 skip_invalid	
boolean
true
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if any invalid cryptocurrencies are requested or a cryptocurrency does not have matching records in the requested timeframe. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

string
Alternatively pass one or more comma-separated cryptocurrency symbols. Example: "BTC,ETH". At least one "id" or "symbol" is required.

 convert	
string
Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 120 currencies at once by passing a comma-separated list of cryptocurrency or fiat currency symbols. Each additional convert option beyond the first requires an additional call credit. A list of supported fiat options can be found here. Each conversion is returned in its own "quote" object.

 convert_id	
string
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

 skip_invalid	
boolean
true
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if any invalid cryptocurrencies are requested or a cryptocurrency does not have matching records in the requested timeframe. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

Quotes Historical v2
Returns an interval of historic market quotes for any cryptocurrency based on time and interval parameters.

Please note: This documentation relates to our updated V2 endpoint, which may be incompatible with our V1 versions. Documentation for deprecated endpoints can be found here.

Technical Notes

A historic quote for every "interval" period between your "time_start" and "time_end" will be returned.
If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "interval" will be applied in reverse from "time_end".
If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
At each "interval" period, the historic quote that is closest in time to the requested time will be returned.
If no historic quotes are available in a given "interval" period up until the next interval period, it will be skipped.
Implementation Tips

Want to get the last quote of each UTC day? Don't use "interval=daily" as that returns the first quote. Instead use "interval=24h" to repeat a specific timestamp search every 24 hours and pass ex. "time_start=2019-01-04T23:59:00.000Z" to query for the last record of each UTC day.
This endpoint supports requesting multiple cryptocurrencies in the same call. Please note the API response will be wrapped in an additional object in this case.
Interval Options
There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "interval".

The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
"hourly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar hour.
"daily" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar day.
"weekly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar week.
"monthly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar month.
"yearly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar year.

The second are relative time intervals.
"m": Get the first quote available every "m" minutes (60 second intervals). Supported minutes are: "5m", "10m", "15m", "30m", "45m".
"h": Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h".
"d": Get the first quote available every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".

Price Conversion v2
Convert an amount of one cryptocurrency or fiat currency into one or more different currencies utilizing the latest market rate for each currency. You may optionally pass a historical timestamp as time to convert values based on historical rates (as your API plan supports).

Please note: This documentation relates to our updated V2 endpoint, which may be incompatible with our V1 versions. Documentation for deprecated endpoints can be found here.

Technical Notes

Latest market rate conversions are accurate to 1 minute of specificity. Historical conversions are accurate to 1 minute of specificity outside of non-USD fiat conversions which have 5 minute specificity.
You may reference a current list of all supported cryptocurrencies via the cryptocurrency/map endpoint. This endpoint also returns the supported date ranges for historical conversions via the first_historical_data and last_historical_data properties.
Conversions are supported in 93 different fiat currencies and 4 precious metals as outlined here. Historical fiat conversions are supported as far back as 2013-04-28.
A last_updated timestamp is included for both your source currency and each conversion currency. This is the timestamp of the closest market rate record referenced for each currency during the conversion.
This endpoint is available on the following API plans:

Basic (Latest market price conversions)
Hobbyist (Latest market price conversions + 1 month historical)
Startup (Latest market price conversions + 1 month historical)
Standard (Latest market price conversions + 3 months historical)
Professional (Latest market price conversions + 12 months historical)
Enterprise (Latest market price conversions + up to 6 years historical)
Cache / Update frequency: Every 60 seconds for the lastest cryptocurrency and fiat currency rates.
Plan credit use: 1 call credit per call and 1 call credit per convert option beyond the first.
CMC equivalent pages: Our cryptocurrency conversion page at coinmarketcap.com/converter/.


Parameters
query Parameters ?
 amount	
number [ 1e-8 .. 1000000000000 ] Required
An amount of currency to convert. Example: 10.43

 id	
string
The CoinMarketCap currency ID of the base cryptocurrency or fiat to convert from. Example: "1"

 symbol	
string
Alternatively the currency symbol of the base cryptocurrency or fiat to convert from. Example: "BTC". One "id" or "symbol" is required. Please note that starting in the v2 endpoint, due to the fact that a symbol is not unique, if you request by symbol each quote response will contain an array of objects containing all of the coins that use each requested symbol. The v1 endpoint will still return a single object, the highest ranked coin using that symbol.

 time	
string
Optional timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to reference historical pricing during conversion. If not passed, the current time will be used. If passed, we'll reference the closest historic values available for this conversion.

 convert	
string
Pass up to 120 comma-separated fiat or cryptocurrency symbols to convert the source amount to.

 convert_id	
string
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

OHLCV Historical v1 (deprecated)
Returns historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data along with market cap for any cryptocurrency using time interval parameters. Currently daily and hourly OHLCV periods are supported. Volume is not currently supported for hourly OHLCV intervals before 2020-09-22.

Technical Notes

Only the date portion of the timestamp is used for daily OHLCV so it's recommended to send an ISO date format like "2018-09-19" without time for this "time_period".
One OHLCV quote will be returned for every "time_period" between your "time_start" (exclusive) and "time_end" (inclusive).
If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "time_period" will be calculated in reverse from "time_end" using the "count" parameter which defaults to 10 results.
If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
If you don't need every "time_period" between your dates you may adjust the frequency that "time_period" is sampled using the "interval" parameter. For example with "time_period" set to "daily" you may set "interval" to "2d" to get the daily OHLCV for every other day. You could set "interval" to "monthly" to get the first daily OHLCV for each month, or set it to "yearly" to get the daily OHLCV value against the same date every year.
Implementation Tips

If querying for a specific OHLCV date your "time_start" should specify a timestamp of 1 interval prior as "time_start" is an exclusive time parameter (as opposed to "time_end" which is inclusive to the search). This means that when you pass a "time_start" results will be returned for the next complete "time_period". For example, if you are querying for a daily OHLCV datapoint for 2018-11-30 your "time_start" should be "2018-11-29".
If only specifying a "count" parameter to return latest OHLCV periods, your "count" should be 1 number higher than the number of results you expect to receive. "Count" defines the number of "time_period" intervals queried, not the number of results to return, and this includes the currently active time period which is incomplete when working backwards from current time. For example, if you want the last daily OHLCV value available simply pass "count=2" to skip the incomplete active time period.
This endpoint supports requesting multiple cryptocurrencies in the same call. Please note the API response will be wrapped in an additional object in this case.
Interval Options

There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "time_period" and "interval" parameters. For "time_period" these return aggregate OHLCV data from the beginning to end of each interval period. Apply these time intervals to "interval" to adjust how frequently "time_period" is sampled.

The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
"hourly" - Hour intervals in UTC.
"daily" - Calendar day intervals for each UTC day.
"weekly" - Calendar week intervals for each calendar week.
"monthly" - Calendar month intervals for each calendar month.
"yearly" - Calendar year intervals for each calendar year.

The second are relative time intervals.
"h": Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h".
"d": Time periods that repeat every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".

Please note that "time_period" currently supports the "daily" and "hourly" options. "interval" supports all interval options.

Time period to return OHLCV data for. The default is "daily". If hourly, the open will be 01:00 and the close will be 01:59. If daily, the open will be 00:00:00 for the day and close will be 23:59:99 for the same day. See the main endpoint description for details.

 time_start	
string
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to start returning OHLCV time periods for. Only the date portion of the timestamp is used for daily OHLCV so it's recommended to send an ISO date format like "2018-09-19" without time.

 time_end	
string
Timestamp (Unix or ISO 8601) to stop returning OHLCV time periods for (inclusive). Optional, if not passed we'll default to the current time. Only the date portion of the timestamp is used for daily OHLCV so it's recommended to send an ISO date format like "2018-09-19" without time.

 count	
number [ 1 .. 10000 ]
10
Optionally limit the number of time periods to return results for. The default is 10 items. The current query limit is 10000 items.

 interval	
string
"daily"
"hourly""daily""weekly""monthly""yearly""1h""2h""3h""4h""6h""12h""1d""2d""3d""7d""14d""15d""30d""60d""90d""365d"
Optionally adjust the interval that "time_period" is sampled. For example with interval=monthly&time_period=daily you will see a daily OHLCV record for January, February, March and so on. See main endpoint description for available options.

 convert	
string
By default market quotes are returned in USD. Optionally calculate market quotes in up to 3 fiat currencies or cryptocurrencies.

 convert_id	
string
Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

 skip_invalid	
boolean
true
Pass true to relax request validation rules. When requesting records on multiple cryptocurrencies an error is returned if any invalid cryptocurrencies are requested or a cryptocurrency does not have matching records in the requested timeframe. If set to true, invalid lookups will be skipped allowing valid cryptocurrencies to still be returned.

Quotes Historical v1 (deprecated)
Returns an interval of historic market quotes for any cryptocurrency based on time and interval parameters.

Technical Notes

A historic quote for every "interval" period between your "time_start" and "time_end" will be returned.
If a "time_start" is not supplied, the "interval" will be applied in reverse from "time_end".
If "time_end" is not supplied, it defaults to the current time.
At each "interval" period, the historic quote that is closest in time to the requested time will be returned.
If no historic quotes are available in a given "interval" period up until the next interval period, it will be skipped.
Implementation Tips

Want to get the last quote of each UTC day? Don't use "interval=daily" as that returns the first quote. Instead use "interval=24h" to repeat a specific timestamp search every 24 hours and pass ex. "time_start=2019-01-04T23:59:00.000Z" to query for the last record of each UTC day.
This endpoint supports requesting multiple cryptocurrencies in the same call. Please note the API response will be wrapped in an additional object in this case.
Interval Options
There are 2 types of time interval formats that may be used for "interval".

The first are calendar year and time constants in UTC time:
"hourly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar hour.
"daily" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar day.
"weekly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar week.
"monthly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar month.
"yearly" - Get the first quote available at the beginning of each calendar year.

The second are relative time intervals.
"m": Get the first quote available every "m" minutes (60 second intervals). Supported minutes are: "5m", "10m", "15m", "30m", "45m".
"h": Get the first quote available every "h" hours (3600 second intervals). Supported hour intervals are: "1h", "2h", "3h", "4h", "6h", "12h".
"d": Get the first quote available every "d" days (86400 second intervals). Supported day intervals are: "1d", "2d", "3d", "7d", "14d", "15d", "30d", "60d", "90d", "365d".

 convert_id

Optionally calculate market quotes by CoinMarketCap ID instead of symbol. This option is identical to convert outside of ID format. Ex: convert_id=1,2781 would replace convert=BTC,USD in your query. This parameter cannot be used when convert is used.

 skip_invalid

 reverse_order	
string
Pass true to invert the order of a spot pair. For example, a trading pair is set up as Token B/Token A in the contract and is commonly referred to as Token A/Token B. Using reverse_order would change the order to reflect the true Token B/Token A pairing as it exists in the pool.
